1 - Create a margin percent function
    We want to create a macro to calculate the margin percent (%)

    1. - In the macros folder, create a functions.sql file.

    1.2 - Inside, define the macro margin_percent taking as argument revenue and purchase_cost

        {% macro  <your code here>  %}
        ...
        {% endmacro %}

    1.3 - Then define what the macro should return (margin percent = margin / revenue)

        {% macro ... %}
            <your code here> 
        {% endmacro %}

    1.4 - Finally, you can decide to round your result and keep 2 as precision by default.

2 - Use Macros in the models

    2.1 - Edit your int_sales_margin.sql to add a column with margin percent.
        {{ function(…) }}


3 - Use Macros from Package
dbt_utils is the most famous package of dbt, you need to install it before using functions.

    3.1 - Let’s use the function dbt_utils.union_relations to simplify int_campaigns.sql by removing the UNION ALL.
